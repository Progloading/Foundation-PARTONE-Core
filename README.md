($$) ABOUT

This repository is the core “PART ONE” foundation of a larger data pipeline / systems engineering learning journey. It is intended as the first step in a series of modules exploring how to build systems “like a machine.”  

It serves both as a learning artifact and a starting scaffold. Over subsequent parts, you may layer more complexity, integrations, persistence, orchestration, etc.

_______

($$) FEATURES

- Basic input/output scaffolding (e.g. `In_Out.java`)  
- Core logic and structure to build upon  
- Quotes and “friends / close friends” text files (for illustrative or data-seeding purpose)  
- MIT License, permitting free use and alteration  

_______

($$) GETTING STARTED

($$$) Prerequisites

    - Java JDK (version 8 or greater recommended)  
    - Maven or Gradle (if you intend to build with a build tool)  
    - Git (to clone the repo)  

($$$) Installation / Build

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Progloading/Foundation-PARTONE-Core.git
   cd Foundation-PARTONE-Core

2. (Optional) If using Build Tool:

    (With Maven)
   
   ```bash
    mvn clean compile
   ```
    (With Gradle)

   ```bash
   gradle build
   ```

3. Alternatively, JAVAC for simple code:

   ```bash
   javac In_Out.java
   ```

($$) USAGE

  ```bash
  // Assuming compiled -> run
  java In_Out
  ```

Over time, new packages, modules, and/or layers (e.g. core/, piepline/, modules/) might be introduced
in later parts.

($$) CONTRIBUTING

Contributions are welcome! Always open to new tactics and procedures.

1. Fork repository
2. Create future branch
3. Make necessary changes
4. Submit a pull request w/ explanations

For larger changes (e.g. rafactoring the core, introducing new modules), let's discuss via GitHub issues or discussions
before implementation.

($$) ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS / INSPIRATION

This project is part of the Foundation Series, a structured initiative focused on mastering data pipeline dsevelopment and systems engineering fundamentals. Developed by me, Progloading, it serves as a professioonal portfolio artifact highlighting proficiency in software design, modular architecture, and secure system implementation. 

The PART-ONE-CORE module establishes the essential framework for subsequent components that will integrate advanced concepts such as data orchestration, API interaction, and security enhancment. 

The work is inspired by best practices in enterprise software engineering, DevSecOps methodology, and the principles of progressive system design--building reliable, scalable, and secure solutions from the ground up.
